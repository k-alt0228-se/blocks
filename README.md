A compilation of my work in Scratch and Snap!

  I find Scratch to be a very accepting and social community to share code and learn, however, over the years it has become so much more similar to other social media sites and that disappoints me. Snap! on the other hand, I wish was more social. I think the only social feature I want for Snap!, though, is hidden following. Like you could follow people to create a custom feed and get notifications when they post new projects or add something to a collection, but there is no way to see how many followers you or anyone else has - that data just isn't stored. I agree with the Snap! team that computer science is not a popularity contest and likes, favorites, and views don't help a maker improve a project. But comments can! And custom feeds can inspire creators to do what they love and learn at the same time.
  
  To my point, basically this is going to hold downloads of my Snap! and Scratch projects to share them in a place that is actually my favorite. GitHub kinda makes me unreasonably happy compared to Scratch. I don't want to care about how many views I have on a Scratch project or how a Snap! project would be so much harder to make in Scratch if I just have a place for both.
  
  The linked (beta) project has information about all my current, future, and previous projects using blocky code. When something is finished it's card  will be archived and the code will be added to the respective repository branch it belongs to. I am not a huge fan of the issues feature, the way it works, so I will probably only end up using that for like bugs and things? Not sure yet.
  
  In beta projects, when you hover over a card name, it turns into a link. Click on these links to find the project notes/instrutions + notes/credits. All finished projects (projects in the "Done" category) should have these for you to find plus the project file (once the initial setup of the projects file is done).
